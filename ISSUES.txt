- The whole mvc situation is kind of a mess, and should be fixed
    
    -   The grid texture should come frome outside, so we don't
        have to acces view from speedcontroller (to only copy
        from the texture when we really want to draw everything)
        -> this also enables copying on resize
        
    -   mvc is for making user interfaces, so it's probably not
        appropriate here

        
- speedcontroller should be reworked (initializiation etc)


- rework poc zoom


- rework interaaction with console:

    - should be handled by a seperate class
    - non-blocking?
    - handle getting sizes in a uniform way

- unify input handling, hotkeys

- make on the fly mutation possible (without restarting the whole sim)
