- The whole mvc situation is kind of a mess, and should be fixed
    - The grid texture should come frome outside, so we don't
        have to acces view from speedcontroller (to only copy
        from the texture when we really want to draw everything)
        -> this also enables copying on resize
        
- speedcontroller should be reworked (initializiation etc)
