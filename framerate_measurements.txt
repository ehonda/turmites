BASELINE (NO RENDERING, NO DELAY, UPDATES INCLUDED)

1) Compute frame:
                            ~1'000'000 FPS

                            
DELAY MEASUREMENTS (NO RENDERING, UPDATES INCLUDED)

1) Delay every frame:
                            ~500 FPS
                            
2) Delay every 100th frame:
                            ~50'000 FPS
                            
=> Delay every nth frame:
                            ~500n FPS
                            

RENDERING MEASUREMENTS (NO DELAY, UPDATES INCLUDED)

1) Render every frame:
                            ~60 FPS
                            
2) Render every 100th frame:
                            ~6000 FPS
                            
3) Render every 1000th frame:
                            ~60'000 FPS
                            
=> Render every nth frame:
                            ~60n FPS
                            
                            
                            
CONCLUSIONS

- Rendering caps framerate more than delay (factor of 10)
    and both cap the framerate linearily
    
- Delay is probably not needed (only for slower speeds)
    
- Bottom line is 1'000'000 FPS without rendering or delay,
    might be optimized but is fine at the moment
    
    
- !The flag SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC on initializing the
    renderer limits the frame rate to the screens refresh 
    rate, which is not what we want here. See:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21949479/is-there-a-frame-rate-cap-built-into-sdl-2-0?rq=1
    
- Implement speeding up by rendering fewer frames and speeding
    down by waiting between rendering (each) frame
