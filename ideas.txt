- Multiple ants on field
- Mutate ants

- Drawing:
    -> Make grid size independent of screen size
    -> Redraw on resize etc
    -> Zoom feature
    
- User interaction
    -> change grid size without entering new ant
    -> mutate ant
    -> cli command to place new ant, show list of active ants, edit active ants etc
    
- Implementation
    -> Implement observer/subscriber mechanisms as abstract base classes, using signals2
    -> Make CLI class to systemize the cli commands interaction
    
    
- User stories:
    -> place several (slightly different) ants, maybe mutated versions of a ruleset, 
        on the same grid and see them interact
